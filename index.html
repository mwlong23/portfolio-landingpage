          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>My name is Mitch Long, welcome to my portfolio. I’m a student in the Ruby on Rails track at Epicodus. Here I’m learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby and Rails. I’m a curious tinkerer and life-long learner with a keen interest in web development. Code, code, code.  Before joining Epicodus I worked with startups, product development and scientific research. I’m passionate about science, technology and development.  Have any questions, comments or want to grab a coffee? <a href="mailto:mwlong23@gmail.com">Message me</a> .</p>

                <p>Everyone has a place that really makes them feel at home. Unfortunately, mine is a long flight and many miles out of reach.  This inspired me to create a webpage I could visit when my happy place is out of reach.  Favorite Places is a page designed to showcase all of my favorite places and remind me of why it’s so fun to visit them. </p>

                <p>TAre you thinking about taking a vacation anytime soon?  Lord knows I need one, but where would I go and what would I do. Vacation Destination is a webpage featuring a fully-loaded travel package that takes travelers out of this world. This project was built using HTML, custom CSS and Bootstrap to tie everything together. </p>

                <p>At Epicodus there's no denying the importance of customizing bootstrap elements using your own custom CSS stylesheet. Wiki-clone is my attempt at cloning the wikipedia hompage using HTML, my own custom CSS stylesheet and Bootstrap. This exercise demonstrated how much detail goes into each and every webpage.</p>

                <p>If you’re looking for a furry friend and don’t know where to start this webpage is for you.  Animal Shelter is a webpage that links animals in need of adoption with families who are looking for a new pet. Written in basic html and a custom CSS stylesheet, this page isn’t fancy but it provides a much needed service to pets in need.</p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>My background and work history is broad and far reaching. I have industry experience at Tech startups and biomedical research reaching from the San Francisco Bay Area to Washignton State. Most recently I've focused on Biomedical research and product development. Laboratory science, biochemistry and genetics fascinate me. At the beginning of 2017 I began an internship at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center where I studied Yeast genetics with applications with application in cancer treatment and down syndrome.
      Prior to studying at Fred Hutch, I helped develop futuristic self-disinfecting surfaces at a Biotechnology startup in Spokane, Washington.
      <br>
      My Fascination with The internet and technology began at an early age and I've been tinkering ever since. I enrolled at Epicodus to learn more about web development and computer science.
