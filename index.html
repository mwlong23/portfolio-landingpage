                <p>Everyone has a place that really makes them feel at home. Unfortunately, mine is a long flight and many miles out of reach.  This inspired me to create a webpage I could visit when my happy place is out of reach.  Favorite Places is a page designed to showcase all of my favorite places and remind me of why it’s so fun to visit them. </p>

                <p>Are you thinking about taking a vacation anytime soon?  Lord knows I need one, but where would I go and what would I do.

                <p>At Epicodus there's no denying the importance of customizing bootstrap elements using your own custom CSS stylesheet. Wiki-clone is my attempt at cloning the wikipedia hompage using HTML, my own custom CSS stylesheet and Bootstrap. This exercise demonstrated how much detail goes into each and every webpage.</p></h3>

         <h4>Professional Experience</h4>
         <p>My professional background includes Software, Biotech and Scientific research. I have industry experience at <strong>Software startups</strong> and biomedical research ranging from the <span class="bolden">San Francisco Bay Area</span> to Washignton State. I'm fascinated by genetics and Molecular Biology. At the beginning of 2017 I began an internship at <span class="bolden">Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center</span> where I studied Yeast genetics with applications in cancer treatment and down syndrome.

         Prior to studying at Fred Hutch, I helped develop futuristic self-disinfecting surfaces at a <span class="bolden">Biotechnology startup</span> in Spokane, Washington. These materials are next generation plastics that will be used in medical devices to prevent bacterial infections.</p>
         <p>My Fascination with The internet and technology began at an early age and I've been tinkering ever since. Early in my college career I became interested in computer science. I enrolled at Epicodus to learn more about web development and how it can be applied to solve problems.</p>
